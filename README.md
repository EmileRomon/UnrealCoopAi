# UnrealCoopAI

First Person Shooter (FPS) game I made for my research internship using Unreal Engine 4.22 . This game is the very first one I did using Unreal Engine, and I only used free assets I found.

The subject of this internship was "Unreal Tournament with Cooperative AI"

In this game, you and your 2 Ai-controlled teammates have to defeat the other team in a Deathmatch.

One of your teammate has a "Heal gun" than can heal his teammate while the other one has a sniper rifle than can deal massive damage. Has the name suggest, your teammates while try their best to follow and support you.
